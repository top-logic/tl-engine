# TopLogic - the automated application engine

This is the home of the open-source version of [_TopLogic - the automated application engine_](https://github.com/top-logic/tl-engine).
TopLogic is the only open-source model-based, no-code web application development platform. With TopLogic, you are able to create professional
three-tier web applications using diagram-based modeling (UML and BPMN) in combination with WYSIWYG user-interface 
configuration. 

However, your scope is not limited to the no-code approach. Due to the openness of TopLogic, the engine can be 
customized to your needs and extended with plug-ins at all levels, starting with new UI components, custom services and 
interfaces, custom scripting capabilities and even custom model elements and types.  

TopLogic is provided to you by [Business Operation Systems GmbH](https://top-logic.com/ueber-uns/).

## Getting started

TopLogic features so-called in-app development. This means that most of the development tools are built-in. 
Start creating a new app, which is a three-step process:

1. [Install the engine](https://dev.top-logic.com/tl/content/docs/GetStarted/) and log in.
2. Draw and configure your models, processes, and user interfaces.
3. Start using your new app.

Explore the features of TopLogic in-app development by following the guided tour in the [TopLogic Tutorial](https://dev.top-logic.com/tl/content/docs/Tutorial/).

However, you are not limited to in-app development. When using TopLogic with a team of developers, you can still use 
standard development workflows with repositories, version control, build, and deployment processes. Check out the 
[TopLogic Developer Guide](https://dev.top-logic.com/tl/content/docs/DeveloperGuide/) for deep insights into the TopLogic engine.
