<h2>Return value</h2>

<p>There is no return value. Communication using Apache Kafka is asynchronous.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Sending a string message to the default topic of the producer</h3>

<pre>
<code>kafkaSend(producer: "your-producer", message: "Hello World");</code>
</pre>

<h3>Sending a JSON message to a special topic</h3>

<p>For sending JSON messages, the "generic serializer" must be configured at the producer.</p>

<pre>
<code>kafkaSend(
    producer: "your-producer", 
    topic: "your-topic"	

    message: {
        "question": "Hello World! How are you?",
        "priority": 42
    },
    key: {
        "channel": "irrelevant questions",
        "some-key": "some-value"
    }
    headers: {
        "key-1": "value-1",
        "key-2": "value-2",
        "key-3": "value-3"
    },

    timeout: 10000,
    partition: 0
)</code></pre>

<h2>Configuration of the producer</h2>

<p>Producers are defined in the application configuration. They can be viewed and edited in the Service Editor under "Kafka Producer Service". The Service Editor is located in the "Administration &gt; Development &gt; Service Editor" view.</p>

<p>The message content (<code class="hljs inlineCode">message</code>) and the key (<code class="hljs inlineCode">key</code>) must be able to be processed by the serializers for content and key stored in the producer. To send JSON-formatted messages, it is advisable to use the generic serializer.</p>

<h2>Receiving messages</h2>

<p>To receive messages from an Apache Kafka server, a "receiver" with a "message processor" must be configured in the "Kafka Receiver Service". The "TL script message processor" is available for the in-app configuration. This is configured with a TL script that is called as soon as a message is received.</p>
