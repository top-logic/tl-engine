# Forms and input fields

## Display variants of input fields

A control provider takes options, so the same value is entered in a different shape without a new
element and without a new control: a selection as a cloud of toggles or as a bar of segments, a
number as a handle on a track, a truth value as a switch.

**A selection** — `SelectControlProvider`, option `display` (`SelectDisplay`): `dropdown` (the
default) offers the options in a list that opens on demand and is searched by typing, `chips` draws
every option as a toggle, `segmented` draws them as a bar of segments with a marker sliding to the
chosen one. One server control (`ReactDropdownSelectControl`) serves all three - it keeps the option
index and the value protocol and names the client component to draw the shape with
(`TLDropdownSelect`, `TLOptionChips`, `TLSegmentedChoice`, `TLChoiceGroup`) - so a shape showing
every option is handed the complete option list right away, having nothing to open at which it could
ask for it. The shapes showing every option suit a handful of options; a long list belongs in a
dropdown. `radio` offers every option as a radio button (a checkbox where several values can be
chosen), laid out by `orientation` (`vertical`, the default, or `horizontal`). `filter="false"`
drops the filter input of the dropdown, which then jumps to an option by typing the beginning of its
label.

Where `display` and `orientation` say nothing, the field decides: `FieldSpec.getSelectDisplay()` and
`FieldSpec.getSelectOrientation()`, which `FieldControlService` takes from the model annotations
`<classification-display value="radio|radio-inline|checklist"/>` (an enumeration) and
`<reference-display value="radio|radio-inline"/>` (a reference) - at the attribute, else at its
type. `radio` and `checklist` give vertical radio buttons, `radio-inline` horizontal ones, every other
presentation the dropdown.

```xml
<field attribute="priority">
	<input-control class="com.top_logic.layout.view.form.SelectControlProvider"
		display="segmented"
	/>
</field>
```

**A number** — `NumberInputControlProvider`, option `display` (`NumberDisplay`): `input` (the
default) takes any number the format of the field reads, `slider` drags a handle along a track
between `min` and `max`, snapping to `step` (whole numbers where nothing is stated). A slider needs
its bounds, which `@MandatoryIf(other = @Ref(DISPLAY), value = NumberDisplay.SLIDER_NAME)` demands of
the configuration - `min` and `max` are mandatory as soon as `display` is `slider` and ignored
otherwise - and `@ComparisonDependency` keeps `min` below `max`. The slider exchanges its value as a
number rather than as formatted text, so no locale format reads it.

```xml
<value-input
	type="tl.core:Integer"
	value="level"
>
	<input-control class="com.top_logic.layout.view.form.NumberInputControlProvider"
		display="slider"
		max="10.0"
		min="0.0"
		step="1.0"
	/>
</value-input>
```

**A truth value** — `BooleanControlProvider`, option `display` (`BooleanPresentation`): the box that
is ticked by default, `switch` for a handle sliding between the two states, `radio` and `select` for
a choice between labelled values. `switch` is also a presentation of the model, so an attribute that
is a switch everywhere says so once:

```xml
<property name="active"
	type="tl.core:Boolean"
>
	<annotations>
		<boolean-display presentation="switch"/>
	</annotations>
</property>
```

A value that may also be unknown (`tl.core:Tristate`, a tri-state field) stays a checkbox even where
a switch is asked for: a switch has no third position for "no value".

**Three ways to choose the provider**, in the order `FieldControlService` tries them:

1. `<input-control class="…Provider" …/>` inside a `<field>` (`FieldElement.Config.getInputControl()`)
   or inside a `<value-input>` (`ValueInputElement.Config.getInputControl()`) — the view decides, for
   this one place in the user interface.
2. The `<input-control>` annotation of the model attribute — the model decides, for every place the
   attribute is shown. `<boolean-display presentation="switch"/>` is the same decision said in the
   model's own vocabulary: it reaches the field description as
   `FieldSpec.getBooleanPresentation()`, which `BooleanControlProvider` follows where its own
   `display` says nothing; `<classification-display>` and `<reference-display>` reach
   `SelectControlProvider` the same way.
3. The type map of `FieldControlService` and, failing that, the `FieldControlRegistry` entry for the
   kind of value the type holds.

The display is how the field looks, not what it says: it is a rendering-only state key, kept out of
the headless projection, so a scripted test reads the same options and the same value in every shape.

## Unsaved changes are asked before a channel write, transitively

A form with unsaved input blocks the write of the channel it is bound to: it registers a `ViewChannel.VetoListener` there, and a veto listener answers with the `List<StateHandler>` it objects with, so the dialog asks about every form blocking the change at once (`ViewChannel.dirtyHandlers()` collects the answers, each handler once). A component that writes a channel *from a `ChannelListener` of another one* hands the question on with `VetoForwarder.forward(source, target)` and drops the forwarder in a cleanup action, so the unsaved changes blocking the target are reported when the source is asked — before the source is written. The object list forwards from each of its inputs to the channel holding the draft of the `<new-element>` content, the `<adaptive-detail>` from each `reset-on` master to its selection, the flow diagram from each input to the selection a rebuild drops, and a `<derived-channel>` from its inputs to the derived value a form may be bound to. The `ChannelVetoException` carries a continuation that retries the write of the *source*, so after a discard every listener of the source runs, including the one writing the target. A veto raised from inside a notification is a programming error: the notifying channel already holds its new value, the listeners after the writing one are never told, and the continuation retries the nested write alone.
