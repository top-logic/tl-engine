<p>A new component is created in the <a class="tlObject" href="?page=LayoutEditor&amp;uuid=adeefc25-eac1-41e6-80d8-a685108be450">design mode of</a> the application by filling a component placeholder with a table template. Such an empty space ("component placeholder") can be created by either</p>

<ul>
	<li>adding a new tab in an existing tab bar (the content of this new tab is then inital an empty component placeholder),</li>
	<li>or by adding a component next to an existing component in an existing view via the context menu "Edit Layout".</li>
</ul>

<p>A new component is selected from a set of available layout templates.</p>

<p>The process is then identical for all components. In a further dialog, basic configurations for the new component can be entered. Afterwards the component placeholder is replaced by the new now already fully functional component.</p>

<p>Settings for the new component can then be called up via the context menu "Edit view".</p>
