<p>The layout editor provides an overview of the different parts of the application layout and, in case of a misconfiguration that cannot be corrected by the user himself, offers the possibility to administratively fix the problem.</p> 
<p>In the selection field it is possible to specify the root of the subtree for which the different parts of the layout are to be considered.</p> 
<p>The tree table allows navigation between the different layouts. The layouts can be changed using the editor and are then stored into the database or file system.</p>
