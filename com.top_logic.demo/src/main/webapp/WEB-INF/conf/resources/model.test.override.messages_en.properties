model.test.override = test.override
model.test.override.A = A
model.test.override.A.goLeft = Go left
model.test.override.A.goLeft.tooltip = Selects between the two instances in "Left" and "Right". If clicked, the instance in "Left" is selected as "Root", otherwise the one in "Right".
model.test.override.A.left = Left
model.test.override.A.left.tooltip = First editable reference to another instance of the abstract interface. This instance is selected as the "Root" reference when "Go Left" is checked.
model.test.override.A.parent = Parent
model.test.override.A.right = Right
model.test.override.A.right.tooltip = Second editable reference to another instance of the abstract interface type. This instance is selected as the "Root" reference if "Go Left" is unchecked.
model.test.override.A.root = Root
model.test.override.A.tooltip = Subtype of "I" that overwrites the reference "root" with a calculation rule.
model.test.override.I = I
model.test.override.I.root = Root
model.test.override.I.root.tooltip = Reference that is partially overwritten with calculation rules in subtypes.
model.test.override.I.tooltip = Abstract interface type that defines a reference "root" to type "R". This reference is overwritten with a calculation rule in types "A" and "R". Only the subtype "S" inherits the property "root" unchanged and allows a direct input of the value at the interface.
model.test.override.N = N
model.test.override.N.name = Name
model.test.override.N.name.tooltip = Name of the element to be able to identify it in the table and in form fields,
model.test.override.N.tooltip = Abstract supertype that defines only the name attribute. Otherwise irrelevant for the test
model.test.override.R = R
model.test.override.R.parent = Parent
model.test.override.R.parent.tooltip = Reference to another instance of "R". The last instance is selected as "Root", which is accessible via the chain of "Parent" references.
model.test.override.R.root = Root
model.test.override.R.tooltip = At the same time subtype of "I" with an override of the reference "root" and target type of this reference.
model.test.override.S = S
model.test.override.S.tooltip = Subtype of "I" that inherits the "root" reference unchanged and allows direct input at the interface.
