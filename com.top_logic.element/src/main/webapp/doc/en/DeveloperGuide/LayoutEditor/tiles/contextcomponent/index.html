<p>There are several types of components that can be selected as context components:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Tables</li>
 <li>Tree tables</li>
 <li>Trees</li>
 <li>Tile display of objects</li>
</ul>
<p>For all components the displayed elements are defined by a <a class="tlObject" data-custom="false" href="?page=TLScript&amp;uuid=d1172c3d-4596-48b0-837a-42349d1e3227">TLScript</a> expression.</p>
<p>When an element is selected, this object is not displayed separately, in contrast to a normal component. Instead, it is descended further in the tile hierarchy, so that further components can be configured, which the selected element can now use, e.g. as a model.</p>
